    <p>“My favorite thing is painting people, the connective scenery, and memories of a certain special moment. I started with faces when I was 13yrs old. My mom put us all in Art classes in Mexico, and after that; I never really stopped painting! Skipping my summer break after high school, I enrolled at The Art Institute and developed more of my style. We started sketching human figures and movement.  That was life-changing for me! Gave me all the confidence  and I now can do what I love, making people smile, and cry too. I get to gift them a little precious memory in a piece of watercolor paper. I think that’s why I do this, time stops with a brush in my hand and seeing people’s responses makes me smile.”
